  'paragraph9' => '<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">　Here, let us talk.</span><br>
                  <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> In the past, Telemedica\'s CEO Fujiki was a retired employee of a pharmaceutical company. He was in a post specializing in cardiovascular products, but had some expertise in the cardiovascular field, but was otherwise layman. However, as a pharmacist, he was often consulted by friends, acquaintances, and his family about various diseases.</span></p>',
  'paragraph10' => '<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"My father\'s father had such a diagnosis at the hospital. What do you think of this treatment?"</span></strong><br>

                  <p>&nbsp;</p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">　A proper diagnosis should have been made at the hospital ... why would you ask yourself such a question? It was strange and there was no help for it.</span></p>
                  <p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">　If an AI system that answers such questions from a professional perspective can be created, people who are worried that they may be ill may be more relieved. I started from such a thought and developed an AI system that diagnoses symptoms (this will be transformed into this innovation later!).</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">　Fujiki decided to go to the dispensing pharmacy and home healthcare clinical setting in order to improve the use of this system. Among the patients who responded, <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Some people came to the pharmacy to consult Fujiki on a day other than the consultation day</span>Is. Also multiple. Often.</span></p>',
  'paragraph11' => '<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Speaking of which, Fujiki always did this when explaining the medicine to the patients.</span></p>
                    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"This hurts"</span></strong><br>
                    <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Symptoms appear at such times"</span></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">To the patient talking to, </span></p>
                    <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"So sit down and tell me the story."</span></strong><br>

                    <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Did you do such a test?"</span></strong><br>
                    <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Isn\'t this explanation given by the doctor?"</span></strong></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">After hearing the patient\'s story, he explained that it was a drug to improve the symptoms.</span></p>
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 24pt;">Encounter with "Medical mutual esteem"</span></h2>',

From the first visit to Dr. Kazunari\'s clinic, these four characters have been burned to Fujiki\'s retina and will not leave.</span></p>
                    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  While gaining experience as a pharmacist, he recalled the “internal and external communication training” that he had received many times during his office days.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Medical care is the same as business communication, <span style="background-color: #ffff00;">What is important for healthcare professionals is the “communication style” with patients who are sick and seeking solutions</span>. I started thinking like that.</span><br>
                    <span style="font-size: 14pt;">　Perhaps the "patient communication" that I felt was synonymous with mutual esteem? I came to think that way every time I visited the 髙 floor International Clinic.</span></p>

'paragraph13' => '<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><span style="font-size: 14pt;">　</span></span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">At this time, Telemedica was also developing speakers for auscultation learning. I had sought input from many experts before starting development, but it was almost completed. As a final step, I jumped and knocked on the door of the International Clinic on the 髙 floor to seek input from the auscultation specialist. Dr. Kazuoka 髙 Kai (hereinafter referred to as Dr. 髙 Kai) is a leader in cardiac auscultation, who developed a heart disease simulator. Despite being well received by many medical educators and clinicians up until then, meeting with the first person is truly nervous. "If you get a bad evaluation, you have to start over from the beginning ..."</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  First of all, normal heart sounds.髙 In the hands of the 髙 floor teacher, a wooden stethoscope made by himself. Put it on the Kikuzo to the auscultation speaker and "dock-n-dock" ...</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;"> In a matter of seconds, for Fujiki it was even felt in hours. While waiting for my heart to beat out of my mouth, I waited for the first voice of Dr. Gao.</span></p>
                  <p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"This is fantastic.<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">I can hear heart sounds that are not different from real patients</span>。"</span></strong><br>
                  <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Please let me hear three sounds."</span></strong><br>
                  <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Next is AS"</span></strong><br>
                  <span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>"Do you have an MR?"</strong></span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Mr. Gao gave instructions one after another.</span></p>
                  <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">From the 髙 floor teacher who looked satisfied</span><br>
                  <strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Maybe the thrills?"</span></strong><br>
                  <span style="font-size: 14pt;"> The volume dial of the Kikuzo is touched by Dr. Gao\'s finger and the volume is adjusted. That</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The moment the palm touches the pronunciation surface!</span></p>',
  'paragraph14' => '<p><strong><span style="font-size: 14pt;">"Oh! This is great. It also has a function as a pulper."</span></strong></p>

                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  Telemedica\'s philosophy is to contribute to quality communication between doctors and patients. In an auscultation diagnosis technology, by providing realistic auscultation sound data and a learning environment, an environment where anyone involved in medicine, aspiring physicians, and any occupation or grade can efficiently learn auscultation technology. Is to provide.</span></p>
                <p>&nbsp;</p>
                <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  But how do you study auscultation?</span><br>
                <span style="font-size: 14pt;">Telemedica has solved this problem<span style="background-color: #ffff00;">Simple, unique, and theoretically solved</span> Did.</span></p>',

              <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  The hurdle of self-learning auscultation is still high. The auscultation simulator cannot be used whenever you want. In other words, the difficulties of learning auscultation remain.</span><br>
              <span style="font-size: 14pt;">By combining the auscultation learning application "Ausculaide" with the auscultation speaker "Kikuzo", you can use your own stethoscope to perform auscultation learning with your own stethoscope anytime, anywhere, with the same sound as a living body.

                    In fact, specialists have acquired the skills to express the sounds heard by auscultation through a number of clinics.</span><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In this way, can you reproduce the captured sound with your own expression?</span></p>',

                    With AUSCULAIDE, you can learn only with the app using earphones and headphones. Currently, there are 23 cases of heart sounds and heart murmurs in Ausculaide. Each case has four sounds set for each case, so the total number of sound sources is 92. But that doesn\'t mean you have to remember everything. When I listen to four parts of a case every day, my heart sounds burn to my eardrum.</span></p>

                    <p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">  If studying auscultation becomes so easy, it is clear that consulting skills can be improved in a very short time. If you continue every day for three minutes a day, there is no doubt that your skill will improve.</span></p>

              Q1) Where should I purchase the sound source?</h3>
            <p>A1) You can purchase the auscultation sound source or use the sound source on the auscultation portal site. The auscultation portal site provides 54 types of sound sources (heart sounds, lung sounds, intestinal sounds, Korotkoff sounds) free for individuals. If you press the sound source player button on the portal site top page, a membership registration guide will be displayed. （https://3sportal.telemedica.co.jp/）</p>

            <p><strong><span class="_5yl5">Q2) How do I download the Auska laid app?</span></strong></p>
            <p><span class="_5yl5">A２）この</span><span class="_5yl5">Please register your email address on the page. After the official release of the Ausculaide app (late September to October), we will inform you of the download method to your email address. It will be available for download from the app store.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong><span class="_5yl5">Q3) Is it better to have a Kikuzo as well as an aquarium?</span></strong></p>
            <p><span class="_5yl5">A3) Of course, even if there is no Kikuzo, you can learn auscultation if you have the Ausculaide app. You can listen to the sound of the app with earphones and headphones. However, since a stethoscope is not used in that case, it may be insufficient for auscultation practice. Also, please note that you can\'t touch the thrill without a Kikuzo.</span></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Q4) Can I listen to the sound of a commercially available auscultation CD or DVD with a Kikuzo? </strong></p>
            <p>A4) It is not possible to recommend because you do not know the sound quality or editing of the sound source used, but the Kikuzo has a "function to cancel high frequency sound". Listening through a Kikuzo may reduce noise and make it easier to listen to, even if the sound source is annoying with earphones or headphones.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Q5) Can I listen to sound using a smartphone?</strong></p>
            <p>A5) Ausculaide is a smartphone compatible application. Not compatible with tablets. Kikuzos can be used on smartphones or tablets, and of course on PCs. You can listen to sound by connecting a Kikuzo to any audio device that has an output terminal.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Q6) Can I connect a Kikuzo to the auscultation simulator?</strong></p>
            <p>A6) A simulator with a sound output terminal can be used by connecting a Kikuzo.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Q7) Is it possible to distribute sound when multiple people use Ausculaide?</strong></p>
            <p>A7) If you connect an "audio distributor" to the terminal, multiple people can listen to the sound at the same time. The distributed sound can be heard with earphones, but it is also possible to connect a Kikuzo. * If distributed, the sound pressure will be reduced. Please adjust the volume before use.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p><strong>Q8) Is there a guarantee if the Kikuzo breaks down?</strong></p>
            <p>A8) There is a warranty period for one year from the purchase of the Kikuzo. Contact the place of purchase for warranty details.</p>',
