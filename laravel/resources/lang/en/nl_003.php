                              Also, auscultation is an art that can&#39;t be replaced by any other device,

                              is that the word rale is called death rattle, meaning the throat of the patient 
                              just before he died. After that, there were many twists and turns in the classification 
                              of auscultation sounds, but at the 10th International Lung Sound Conference held in Japan in 1984, 
                              the classification of lung sounds and a table of terms in each country were compiled. The conference

                              characteristic heart sounds and lung sounds of each disease is considered to be the only way
