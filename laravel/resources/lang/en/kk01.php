Put the stethoscope on the Kikuzo face in the same way as you would listen to a real patient’s body sounds. When using the diaphragm, press firmly against the "silicon surface", low sounds (S3 and/or S4) will not be heard from your stethoscope.  On the other hand, if you listen to the bell surface lightly, you will hear low pitch sounds. </p>

The black line is the Kikuzo. As shown in the figure, you can see that the Kikuzo plays only bands between 20Hz and 1,000Hz.</p>
                      <p>The characteristic of not reproducing sound above 1,000Hz indicates that the electronic noise (high frequency noise) generated when recording and/or playing with electronic equipment is not reproduced. When listening to sound sources, the Kikuzo will be easier to listen to as it shuts out high-frequency noises.</p>
                      <p>Also, if you look at the low frequency bands, the 20 Hz band is also output firmly. S3 is a low frequency sound, and ordinary small speakers cannot play in this band. </p>',
