    The cardiology patient simulator "K" was developed in 1993. In 1997, its educational effectiveness of this study was reported in CARDIOLOGY. Even today, most of the university medical schools and medical colleges in Japan as well as many foreign countries have been using this simulator for their educational activities.

    The advancement in diagnostic instruments using high technology has been remarkable in the last few decades. However, there is a tendency for many clinicians to become too dependent on these highly sophisticated instruments and to forget the importance of bedside clinical skills.

    I believe that we have an excellent inborn sensor to recognize "organ language" and are able to detect minor changes of physical findings, such as heart sounds or murmurs of heart diseases.

    The Kikuzo speaker is used as an exciting teaching tool, whenever and wherever the self-learning of auscultation is needed. Please start with normal heart sounds and advance to each case at your own pace. So, you will be able to recognize various abnormal sounds and murmurs. The "Kikuzo" will be a great auscultation aide for you.
