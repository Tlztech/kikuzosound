                            there is an intuition that the position of the pharmacist will change and

                            much debate as the urban legend that "pharmacists should not touch the 
                            patient&#39;s body" was widely believed. However, by organizing the legal situation 
                            and clarifying the purpose, it is gradually spreading, and now its understanding and

                            is very different from that of a doctor. To put it simply, doctors know the condition of the 
                            patient and take vital signs to diagnose the underlying disease, but pharmacists show that 
                            the medicines they dispensed work well and have side effects. Use vital signs to determine 
                            if you are not.',

    'paragraph_3'     => 'For example, for auscultation, I basically believe that pharmacists do not need to hear 
                            heart sounds. Of course, doctors will listen to these differently to diagnose the disease 
                            that causes heart failure. However, at this time there are no drugs that improve 
                            valvular disease or close atrial or ventricular septal defects, so there is no need 
                            for a pharmacist to listen. On the other hand, breath sounds need to be learned 
                            and used by pharmacists. For example, in asthma, not only is the sound of airway constriction 
                            caused by edema of the bronchial mucosa and spasm of bronchial smooth muscle improved 
                            by Î²2 agonists, theophylline derivatives, steroids, etc., but also due to disturbance of 
                            compliance. Identify side effects and insufficient drug efficacy due to overdose or 
                            reduced adherence, and provide optimal medication guidance based on these, 
                            and discuss with doctors to improve the next prescription. Because it is required. 
                            Also, if you can hear the breathing sound yourself, sharing it with the patient will enhance 
                            the content of medication instruction and eventually lead to improved adherence.',

                              is undoubtedly important, but listening to sounds with speakers or earphones is not enough 
                              as a practice method that is useful for clinical practice. Practical training can be provided 
                              by training the eardrum to the organ language by listening to the sound with your own stethoscope, 
                              and training how to hear it with your own tools.',
