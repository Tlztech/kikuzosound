    I remember 35 years ago when I first realized, “I have finally grasped the art of auscultation!” As a new intern I was assigned to the cardiology ward where one of my tasks was to listen to the chest sounds of a patient with five different cardiac conditions: mitral valve stenosis, mitral valve regurgitation, aortic valve stenosis, aortic valve regurgitation, and tricuspid valve regurgitation. But all I heard was a whirring sound and had no idea what it was. From that day on, every morning when I went to the ward, I spent dozens of minutes auscultating her chest. One day, about 10 days later, I suddenly heard several distinct sounds. I was able to differentiate the sound of mitral stenosis from that of aortic regurgitation. Auscultation is not something that can be understood by attempting it once. Listening carefully over and over again is what turns a noise into meaningful sounds. It is said that auscultation is not done with the ears, but between the ears. I encourage everyone to train what lies between the ears by listening carefully again and again.
