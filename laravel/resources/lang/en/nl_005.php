                             Auscultation involves examining these body sounds from outside the body using a stethoscope. 
                             However, a stethoscope cannot be performed simply by applying a stethoscope to the body. The body sound heard from a 
                             stethoscope reflects the condition of the organ, and the body sound cannot be identified without understanding the structure 
                             of the sound. In order to understand the characteristics of body sounds and distinguish sounds, CDs created using 
                             recorded body sounds or synthesized body sounds as sound sources, There are DVD and Web materials. On the other hand, 
                             various sounds are generated at the same time in the living body, but since the way of hearing differs depending 
                             on the place where the stethoscope is applied, the sound can not be heard unless you listen carefully to the target body sound 
                             and select it. The auscultation simulator is effective for learning auscultation techniques for selectively listening 
                             for body sounds using a stethoscope. In recent years, in addition to these learning methods, new learning using small speakers 
                             dedicated to auscultation has become possible. In this paper, 3S is a dedicated auscultation speaker

    'paragraph_2'    => 'It is generally said that the sound that can be heard by human hearing is about 20Hz to 20,000Hz. On the other hand, the main frequency of heart sounds is a low frequency of about 100 Hz, and it can be heard by the human ear using a stethoscope. However, when the sound is processed by the auditory central system, it is said that if there is no information (knowledge) about the auscultation sound, it will cause a mistake in sound source identification, so it is difficult for a beginner of auscultation to distinguish heart sounds. I am. To understand the structure of sounds and recognize them as meaningful sounds, knowledge learning using reference books is effective. However, we need to be aware that there is a limit to learning sounds using letters and that there are individual differences in how we hear sounds. A dog barking is described as "one-one" in Japan, but "bow-wah" in the United States. This can happen with auscultation. Therefore, in auscultation learning, it is important to actually listen to various sound sources. In a study conducted by the author, when a medical student listened to real III and IV sounds of a heart sound auscultation simulator and easy-to-understand (increased volume) III and IV sounds, a real (amplified volume) The correct answer rate for the unacceptable III and IV sounds was 13% and 26%, while the easy to understand III and IV sounds were 91% and 95%. In addition, the correct answer rate when listening to realistic III and IV sounds after listening to easy-to-understand III and IV sounds increased to 80% and 91%. As a sound source, it is important to listen to real auscultation sounds, but it is also necessary to listen to easy-to-understand auscultation sounds. When listening to the sound source of CD, DVD and Web materials using speakers when conducting auscultation learning in a group, it is generally difficult to hear the bass. Also, when other noises are heard, the effect of auscultation learning may not improve unless the learner listens strongly to the sound that is heard. Using headphones or earphones helps to eliminate other noises and make it easier to concentrate on the sound, but these methods are passive listening as well as music, and auscultation of body sounds requires additional nerves. I think concentration is needed. On the other hand, when using a Kikuzo, the learner is more likely to focus on the sound by actively touching the Kikuzo to the stethoscope. Also, learners who have auscultation listen to themselves at a volume that is appropriate for them, so there is no effect on other learners who have not auscultated, and the instructor can provide a more effective learning environment Will be If there are many learners, it is possible to distribute sound to multiple Kikuzo at the same time by using an earphone splitter (distributor) to connect the sound source and the Kikuzo. If the number of series is too large, the volume will decrease, but there is no problem for normal use because the volume can be adjusted with the Kikuzo',

    'paragraph_3'    => 'Kikuzo is a speaker specializing in auscultation developed by Telemedica. The size of the main body is 76 mm x 135 mm x 35.5 mm, weighs 210 g, and is palm-sized. A strap bracket is attached to the side of the main unit, so that a simulated patient can hang from the neck. The main unit has a built-in small pioneer speaker developed to reproduce body sounds. A stethoscope is applied to the 55-mm diameter auscultation part acoustic silicon on the top surface of the main unit. Connect the audio source terminal to the stereo mini jack on the side of the main unit with a 3.5mm audio cable to play the sound. The Kikuzo is powered by two AA batteries and has a built-in amplifier so you can adjust the volume',

    'paragraph_4'   => 'A simulator for auscultation such as heart sounds and breath sounds has a built-in speaker at the auscultation site, and it is highly effective for auscultation learning because it searches for sounds with a stethoscope, concentrates consciousness while distinguishing body sounds, and performs auscultation. It seems. However, because the auscultation site is limited, multiple people cannot auscultate at the same time at the same time, and it takes a lot of time to learn. Another challenge is that it is difficult for the learners to keep their concentration because one learner waits while the other is auscultating. This problem can be solved by using multiple auscultation simulators, but it seems difficult in terms of price, so we connected the Kikuzo to the auscultation simulator, Multiple people can listen to the same sound at the same time while watching a scene. You cannot use a stethoscope to search for sounds, but listening to sounds using a stethoscope will increase the learner&#39;s concentration, which may improve stethoscope abilities. In addition, since the volume can be adjusted with the Kikuzo, it is thought that the volume that can be easily listened to for each learner will promote understanding and shorten the time.',

However, each simulator does not reproduce all human phenomena, so if there are missing functions depending on the learning content, they may be used in combination with other simulators. For example, there is HeartWorks (Nihon Light Service Co., Ltd.) as a simulator used to learn echocardiography. It is an excellent simulator that can learn abundant cases with realistic echo images, but we also use a heart auscultation simulator when learning the pathology of the heart. However, if you have an Kikuzo to, you will be able to hear the heart sounds of heart diseases that have echo images (at the position where the HeartWorks sector probe is applied), which will deepen your understanding of the condition. In addition, it is also possible to reproduce the vibration and thrill of the chest wall due to aortic stenosis with an Kikuzo to it. When the volume of the Kikuzo is increased, the silicon surface of the body vibrates, and you can experience a thrill-like palpation. In addition, the general purpose auscultation simulator does not have a blood pressure measurement function. However, in aortic regurgitation and aortic stenosis, learning the effects on blood pressure at the same time as cardiac auscultation will enhance the understanding of the pathology.
